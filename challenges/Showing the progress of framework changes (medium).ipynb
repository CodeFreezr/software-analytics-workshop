    "### Background\n",
    "In software systems, there is a need to change some code that is entangled in all the other code parts of your system. Especially when you need to replace a framework, huge efforts and endurance are needed to successfully change from one framework to the another. Here it is crucial to deliver  information about the current progress of the replacement activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you should demonstrate the progress of the replacement of a database access framework. In particular, there is some code that uses a library called \"Java Database Connectivity\" (or \"JDBC\" for short). This library has many custom code that is now supported by a more advanced library called \"Java Persistence API\" (or \"JPA\" for short). Show the progress in regards of existing source code lines for both technologies!"
